## Setup
* Replace `API_KEY` property with your Desktime API Key. You can get your API Key from `https://desktime.com/app/api`
* Replace `MANAGERS` property based on the following example:
    * `manager1:1568,5629,1563,1534,1567,1642,2920,354,305,401,474; manager2:395,156,401`
    * `manager1` and `manager2` are the names of managers and numbers are the ids of employees under these managers.
* Replace `DAILY_WORK_HOURS` property with your company's daily work hours. (Weekends are assumed to be holidays.)
